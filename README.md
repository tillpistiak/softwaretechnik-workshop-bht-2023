## How to start developing locally?
 The following steps are required to run the application locally on **MacOS**. Please make sure [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), [SDKMAN](https://brew.sh/) and [Git](https://www.git-scm.com/downloads) are already present on your machine. 

For other operating systems the same tools are required. For installation guides please refer to the official documentation.
1. install necessary software <br>
   - Java JDK 17 (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
      ```bash
      sdk install java 17.0.10-amzn
      ```
   - IDE (https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
      ```bash
      brew install vscode
      ```
   - Docker (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
      ```bash
      brew install docker
      ```
   - Maven (https://maven.apache.org/install.html) <br>
     :information_source: you can skip this step if you want to use maven wrapper
      ```bash
      brew install maven
      ```
2. checkout and open project in IDE
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tillpistiak/softwaretechnik-workshop-bht-2023.git

   cd softwaretechnik-workshop-bht-2023
   
   code .
   ```

3. start database (make sure docker is already running)
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

4. run app
    ```bash
    mvn clean quarkus:dev
    ```
    :information_source: you can start developing now. Quarkus will recognize most changes itself and apply them via hot reload. Some will require a restart
5. run tests & quality gates
    ```bash
    mvn clean verify
    ```


## How to get it running in the cloud?

### Preparation

#### Digital Ocean

1. create Digital Ocean account, add payment details etc
2. create a new kubernetes cluster (`Kubernetes / Create Cluster`)
   - choose Frankfurt as datacenter
   - keep the recommended version 
   - choose a pool & cluster name 
   - select cheapest options and only one node <br>
     :warning: selecting more than one node will not benefit availability as the application doesnt support running on multiple nodes in parallel at the moment
   - total monthly costs should be 12â‚¬ as of January 2024![create cluster](documentation/screenshots/do_create_cluster.png)

3. create an access token for your local machine
   - go to `API / Tokens / Personal Access Tokens` and click on "Generate New Token"
   - choose a name and select the prefered expiration time
   - enable write access
   - click on "Generate Token"![generate token](documentation/screenshots/do_generate_token.png)
   - copy the generated token, it will be required for the next step
  
4. create

#### Cloudflare

#### Github

### Deployment

### Monitoring

## Lessons Learned
- Nginx config DO
- Write access deployment.yaml / prometheus
- SSL Zertifikate von Cloudflare
- h2 in mem testing
- Derby user


## What's next?
- User Authentication & Roles
- Alert Manager?
- Load Testing
