### Domain !
*A domain is a human-readable, alphanumeric label associated with a specific IP address on the internet. It serves as a user-friendly way to locate and access websites or resources on the World Wide Web. Essentially, a domain name is a part of a larger addressing system known as the Domain Name System (DNS), which translates numerical IP addresses into more memorable names. Domains are organized hierarchically, with top-level domains (TLDs) like .com, .org, and country-code TLDs like .uk or .de. Individuals, organizations, or businesses register domain names to establish a unique online identity and presence. Once registered, a domain can be used for various purposes, including hosting websites, setting up custom email addresses, or directing traffic to specific online services. Domains play a critical role in simplifying the way users navigate the internet, providing a recognizable and standardized naming system for online resources. (ChatGPT)*

### DNS !
*DNS, or Domain Name System, is a decentralized hierarchical system that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses. In the context of operations, DNS plays a critical role in facilitating the routing and accessibility of services or applications over the internet. It provides a scalable and distributed mechanism for mapping domain names to numerical IP addresses, enabling seamless communication between devices and services. (ChatGPT)*

### TLS !
*TLS, or Transport Layer Security, is a cryptographic protocol that ensures secure communication over a computer network. Operating at the transport layer, TLS encrypts data transmissions between applications to protect against eavesdropping and tampering. It is commonly used to secure connections on the internet, such as HTTPS for secure web browsing. In an operational context, TLS is essential for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of data during transit, enhancing the overall security posture of applications and services.
